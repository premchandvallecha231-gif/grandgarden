            <h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
            
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Grand Gardening Pairs) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
            
            <h3>Why We Use Cookies</h3>
            <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Services to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Services. Third parties serve cookies through our Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
            
            <h4>Essential Cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.</p>
            
            <h4>Performance Cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>
            
            <h4>Functionality Cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
            
            <h4>Targeting Cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>

            <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
            <p>Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard for how websites respond to these signals, so our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals. We continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you.

            <h3>Security Measures We Implement</h3>
            <p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, including:</p>
            
            <h4>Technical Safeguards</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect data transmitted between your device and our servers</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We implement strict access controls that limit access to your personal information to authorized personnel only</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
            
            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.</p>
            
            <p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
            
            <h3>Breach Notification</h3>
            <p>In the event of a personal data breach, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
            
            <h3>Your Role in Security</h3>
            <p>You also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your account with anyone. If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will consider that you have authorized the instructions.</p>
            
            <p>You should be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a supervisory authority, so please contact us first.</p>
            
            <h3>Marketing Communications</h3>
            <p>You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us by using the unsubscribe link in any marketing email we send you or by contacting us at any time. Even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we may still send you non-marketing communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p>
            
            <h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
            <p>As described in the "Cookies and Tracking Technologies" section, you can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our Services may become inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
            
            <h3>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. We do not "sell" personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about our users through our Services for purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting, and you can opt out by following the instructions in the "Cookies and Tracking Technologies" section.</p>
            
            <h3>Response Time</h3>
            <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

        <section id="international">
            <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.</p>
            
            <h3>Where We Transfer Your Information</h3>
            <p>We have servers and service providers located in various countries around the world, including the United States. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, our primary data centers are located in the United States, and many of our third-party service providers are based in the United States and other countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
            
            <h3>Safeguards for International Transfers</h3>
            <p>We have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy when transferred internationally. These safeguards include:</p>
            
            <h4>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses</h4>
            <p>We use the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all such recipients to protect personal information that they process from the EEA in accordance with European data protection laws.</p>
            
            <h4>Privacy Shield (Historical)</h4>
            <p>While the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework are no longer valid as a basis for transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., we continue to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data, as we believe it represents best practices for data protection.</p>
            
            <h4>Adequacy Decisions</h4>
            <p>Where possible, we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, which means that these countries are deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection.</p>
            
            <h4>Additional Safeguards</h4>
            <p>We also implement additional technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information when transferred internationally, including encryption, access controls, and data minimization.</p>
            
            <h3>Your Rights Regarding International Transfers</h3>
            <p>If you are located in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place for international transfers of your personal information. You can contact us using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy to request more information.</p>
            
            <h3>Binding Corporate Rules</h3>
            <p>We have not adopted Binding Corporate Rules as a transfer mechanism. Instead, we rely on other legally provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders, such as Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Localization</h3>
            <p>In some cases, we may be required to store your personal information in a specific country to comply with local laws. We will inform you if this is the case at the time we collect your personal information.</p>

            <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information. This section describes your CCPA/CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
            
            <h3>Right to Know</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you</li>
                <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you</li>
                <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information</li>
                <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information</li>
                <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you</li>
                <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased</li>
                        <li>Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Right to Delete</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
            
            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities</li>
                <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality</li>
                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law</li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code Â§ 1546 et. seq.)</li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent</li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Right to Correct</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate personal information as directed by you.</p>
            
            <h3>Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to direct us to not sell or share your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). We do not sell personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about our users through our Services for purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting, and you can opt out by following the instructions in the "Cookies and Tracking Technologies" section.</p>
            
            <h3>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
            <p>You have the right to limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services, or for other permitted business purposes. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes that would require us to offer a right to limit under the CCPA/CPRA.</p>
            
            <h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>
            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA/CPRA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA/CPRA, we will not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties</li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Exercising Your Rights</h3>
            <p>To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calling us at +1-888-929-2292</li>
                <li>Emailing us at privacy@grandgardeningpairs.com</li>
                <li>Visiting our website and using our online request form</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
            
            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
            
            <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
            
            <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>
            <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
            
            <p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
            
            <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>
            
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
            
            <h3>Other California Privacy Rights</h3>
            <p>California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section Â§ 1798.83) permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>
