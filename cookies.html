            <h2>Introduction to Cookies</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Grand Gardening Pairs' comprehensive Cookies Policy. This document provides detailed information about how we use cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website grandgardeningpairs.com, use our mobile application, or interact with our online services (collectively, the "Services").</p>
            
            <p>We believe in being transparent about our use of technologies that impact your online experience. This policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, the types of cookies we use, how you can manage your cookie preferences, and your rights regarding our use of cookies.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> By continuing to use our Services, you consent to our use of cookies as described in this policy, unless you have disabled them through your browser settings or our cookie preference center. You can withdraw your consent at any time by adjusting your cookie preferences.</p>

            <h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website owners.</p>
            
            <p>Cookies are created when your browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file. Every time the user returns to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server, enabling the website to "remember" your preferences and actions over time.</p>
            
            <h3>How Cookies Work</h3>
            <p>When you visit a website that uses cookies, the website server requests permission to store a cookie on your device. If you accept, the cookie is stored as a small text file. When you revisit the same website, your browser sends the cookie back to the server, allowing the website to recognize your browser and remember certain information about you.</p>
            
            <p>Cookies typically contain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the server the cookie was sent from</li>
                <li>The lifetime of the cookie</li>
                <li>A value - usually a randomly generated unique number</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The website server uses this information to remember your preferences, keep you logged in, track your browsing behavior, or personalize content.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Websites Use Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies serve several important functions that enhance the user experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Cookies help websites determine if a user is logged in and under which account</li>
                <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> They allow websites to remember users' actions and preferences during a browsing session</li>
                <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Cookies store user preferences, themes, and other settings</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> They monitor and analyze user behavior to improve websites</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Cookies deliver targeted advertisements based on user interests</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
            <p>It's important to understand the distinction between first-party and third-party cookies:</p>
            
            <h4>First-Party Cookies</h4>
            <p>First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting directly. They are generally used to remember your preferences, login information, and other functional aspects of the website. These cookies are typically considered less intrusive from a privacy perspective.</p>
            
            <h4>Third-Party Cookies</h4>
            <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one you are visiting. They are most commonly used for advertising and tracking purposes across multiple websites. For example, if a website includes content from a third party (like an embedded video or social media button), that third party may set a cookie through your browser.</p>
            
            <h3>Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <p>In addition to traditional cookies, we and our partners may use other similar tracking technologies:</p>
            
            <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
            <p>Also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs," web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track user activity. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's device, web beacons are typically embedded in web pages or emails and are used to monitor user behavior and campaign effectiveness.</p>
            
            <h4>Local Storage</h4>
            <p>HTML5 local storage allows websites to store larger amounts of data on a user's device. Unlike cookies, this data is not automatically transmitted to the server with each request. Local storage is often used to improve website performance and enable advanced features.</p>
            
            <h4>Session Storage</h4>
            <p>Similar to local storage, session storage allows websites to store data that persists only for the duration of the page session. The data is deleted when the browser tab is closed.</p>
            
            <h4>IndexedDB</h4>
            <p>IndexedDB is a low-level API for storing significant amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. It's more powerful than local storage and is used for complex web applications.</p>
            
            <h3>Legal Framework for Cookies</h3>
            <p>The use of cookies is regulated by various privacy laws around the world:</p>
            
            <h4>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>
            <p>The GDPR, which applies to users in the European Economic Area (EEA), requires websites to obtain explicit consent for non-essential cookies. The regulation classifies cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation of a website as exempt from the consent requirement.</p>
            
            <h4>ePrivacy Directive</h4>
            <p>Also known as the "Cookie Law," this EU directive specifically addresses the use of cookies and requires informed consent before storing or accessing information on a user's device.</p>
            
            <h4>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h4>
            <p>The CCPA gives California residents the right to opt out of the "sale" of their personal information, which may include certain types of cookies used for targeted advertising.</p>
            
            <h4>Other Regional Laws</h4>
            <p>Various other countries have implemented their own regulations regarding cookies and online tracking, including Brazil's LGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, and others.</p>
            
            <p>At Grand Gardening Pairs, we are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate.</p>

                <p>Targeting or advertising cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</p>
                
                <h4>Purpose of Targeting Cookies</h4>
                <ul>

                <h4>How Targeting Cookies Work</h4>
                <p>Targeting cookies work by tracking your browsing behavior across different websites. This information is used to create a profile of your interests, which is then used to show you advertisements that are more likely to be relevant to you.</p>
                
                <p>These cookies are typically set by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have visited a website, and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</p>
                
                <h4>Our Approach to Targeted Advertising</h4>
                <p>At Grand Gardening Pairs, we believe in responsible advertising practices. We work with advertising partners who comply with industry self-regulation programs and provide opt-out mechanisms. We never use targeting cookies to collect sensitive personal information without your explicit consent.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">

Links to these opt-out tools are provided later in this policy.</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>How to Access Cookie Preferences</h4>
            <p>You can access and change your cookie preferences at any time by:</p>

                <li>Clicking on the "Cookie Preferences" link in the footer of our website</li>
                <li>Clicking on the cookie icon typically located in the bottom corner of the screen</li>

            </ol>

            <h3>Browser Controls</h3>
            <p>All modern web browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences through their settings. The exact process varies by browser, but generally, you can:</p>
            
            <h4>Block All Cookies</h4>
            <p>You can set your browser to block all cookies, including essential ones. However, this may prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to access all or parts of our Services.</p>
            
            <h4>Block Third-Party Cookies</h4>
            <p>Most browsers allow you to block only third-party cookies while allowing first-party cookies. This is often a good balance between privacy and functionality.</p>
            
            <h4>Delete Existing Cookies</h4>
            <p>You can delete cookies that have already been set on your device. This will log you out of websites and reset your preferences.</p>
            
            <h4>Browser-Specific Instructions</h4>
            <p>Here are links to cookie management instructions for popular browsers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a></li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Industry Opt-Out Tools</h3>
            <p>For advertising cookies specifically, there are industry-wide programs that allow you to opt out of targeted advertising:</p>
            
            <h4>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</h4>
            <p>The DAA offers a tool called WebChoices that allows you to control interest-based advertising from participating companies.</p>

            <h4>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</h4>
            <p>The NAI provides an opt-out tool for members who use data for interest-based advertising.</p>
            <p><a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Tool</a></p>
            
            <h4>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)</h4>
            <p>The EDAA offers the Your Online Choices program for European users to control online behavioral advertising.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a></p>
            
            <h4>Important Notes About Opt-Out Tools</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Opt-outs are often cookie-based, so if you clear your cookies, you may need to opt out again</li>
                <li>Opt-outs apply to the specific browser and device you use - you'll need to opt out on each browser and device</li>
                <li>Opting out doesn't mean you won't see ads, just that they won't be targeted based on your interests</li>
                <li>Some opt-out tools may not work if your browser is set to block all cookies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
            <p>Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a signal to websites indicating that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no common standard for how to respond to DNT signals, and our website does not currently respond to these signals.</p>
            
            <p>Instead, we provide the cookie management options described above to give you control over your privacy.</p>
            
            <h3>Mobile Device Controls</h3>
            <p>If you access our Services through a mobile device, you may have additional options for controlling cookies and tracking:</p>
            
            <h4>iOS Devices</h4>
            <p>On Apple iOS devices, you can limit ad tracking through the Settings app:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking</li>
                <li>Toggle "Allow Apps to Request to Track" to disable tracking requests</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Android Devices</h4>
            <p>On Android devices, you can opt out of personalized ads:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to Settings > Google > Ads</li>
                <li>Enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>

            <h4>Essential Cookies</h4>
            <p>If you disable essential cookies, our website may not function properly. You may not be able to:</p>

                <li>Access secure areas of the website</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Performance Cookies</h4>
            <p>If you disable performance cookies, we won't be able to gather information about how you use our website, which may limit our ability to improve our Services based on user behavior.</p>
            
            <h4>Functionality Cookies</h4>
            <p>If you disable functionality cookies, the website may not remember your preferences, and you may need to reset them each time you visit.</p>
            
            <h4>Targeting Cookies</h4>
            <p>If you disable targeting cookies, you may still see advertisements, but they will be less relevant to your interests.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> We recommend allowing essential and functionality cookies for the best user experience. You can disable performance and targeting cookies if you have privacy concerns, though this may limit some website features.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention and Storage</h2>
            <p>This section explains how long we retain data collected through cookies and where this data is stored.</p>
            
            <h3>Cookie Lifespan</h3>
            <p>Different cookies have different lifespans, as indicated in our cookie tables. The duration for which a cookie remains on your device depends on its type:</p>
            
            <h4>Session Cookies</h4>
            <p>Session cookies are temporary and are deleted automatically when you close your browser. They do not have an expiration date set.</p>
            
            <h4>Persistent Cookies</h4>
            <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or until you delete them. The expiration period varies by cookie and can range from a few hours to several years.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Storage Locations</h3>
            <p>Data collected through cookies may be stored in different locations:</p>
            
            <h4>On Your Device</h4>
            <p>Cookies themselves are stored locally on your device. The specific location varies by browser and operating system but is typically in a dedicated cookies folder.</p>
            
            <h4>On Our Servers</h4>
            <p>When cookies transmit data to our servers, that data is stored in secure data centers. We use industry-standard security measures to protect this data.</p>
            
            <h4>Third-Party Servers</h4>
            <p>Data collected by third-party cookies is stored on the servers of those third parties, subject to their respective privacy policies and data protection practices.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Aggregation and Anonymization</h3>
            <p>For analytics and performance cookies, we typically aggregate and anonymize data shortly after collection. This means that the data can no longer be linked back to individual users.</p>
            
            <p>Personal data collected through cookies is processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which outlines our data protection principles and your rights regarding your personal information.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
            <p>You can delete cookies at any time through your browser settings. When you delete cookies, the data associated with those cookies is removed from your device.</p>
            
            <p>For data stored on our servers, we have retention policies that determine how long we keep different types of data. In general:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal data is retained only as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected</li>
                <li>Aggregated and anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for statistical purposes</li>
                <li>We regularly review our data retention practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws</li>
